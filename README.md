# ASTRA
Advanced Satellite Telemetry and Reporting (ASTRA)

ASTRA simulates the ingestion satellite telemetry data, such as temperature, voltage and positional information. 

This telemetry data is read from JSON. ASTRA then aggregates that data by satellite, and uses this to flag anomalies such as low voltage, missing positional information and satellites running above safe operating temperatures.
